Next Monday is 8 days away, so you have to take the current computer weather
models with a grain of salt.  Certain trends can be extracted though.</p>
                                                                                
<p><b>This week...</b><br>
A warm up is definetely in store for the first half of the week with a surface
low pressure sliding off to our east and strengthening southerly flow.  By mid
week an <i>Alberta Clipper</i> slides through the state bringing a chance of
rain and snow to the NE half of the state.  This system will then move to our
east drawing down cold air from Canada.  The last half of the week and into
the weekend looks cooler but mostly precipitation free.</p>
                                                                                
<p><b>For Caucus Monday...</b><br>
As of this time, no major weather system is predicted to effect the weather in
Iowa on Monday.  The GFS model depicts a warm front bisecting the state on
Monday night with the best chance of snow over the NE corner of Iowa.  It
is still too early to tell.</p>
