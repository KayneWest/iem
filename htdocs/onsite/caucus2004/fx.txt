Computer model trends have been to remove the chances of precipitation
this week and strengthen the ridge in the Western US.
                                                                                
<p><b>This week...</b><br>
Very peaceful week looks to be in store, at least on the weather front.  
Very little significant weather to mention.  High and low temperatures 
will be seasonal in the 30s and teens respectively.  A building upper 
level ridge begins to dominate the Western US, which means NW upper level 
flow for us.  Precipitation forecasts are very difficult in NW flow 
regimes, but it is hard to find a major focusing mechanism that will be 
impacting our state.</p>
                                                                                
<p><b>For Caucus Monday...</b><br>
The weather looks to be fully cooperating with anybody that will be 
traveling on Monday.  Normal temperatures with only slight chances of 
precipitation.
