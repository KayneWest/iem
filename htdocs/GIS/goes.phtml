<b>Nav:</b> <a href="/GIS/">GIS</a> > GOES Satellite GIS Products

<p>The <a href="http://www.goes.noaa.gov/">GOES (Geostationary Satellite)</a> 
provide the commonly seen views of clouds from space.  The National Weather
Service is now publishing data from these satellites in <a href="http://www.gis.ssd.nesdis.noaa.gov/">GIS formats</a>.  
Thanks to the generous support of <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">UNIDATA</a>, the IEM processes this data feed and
provides <a href="../ogc/">OGC compliant web services</a> as well as an archive.

<h3>IEM Processing</h3>

<p>Data from the GOES birds is available twice an hour (:15 and :45 after the hour). The most recent product is over 30 minutes old.  The raw data files are
very large (70 MB TIFF images for visible).  The IEM does make these files available, but
they are too large for archiving in their highest resolution form.  For that
reason, the IEM generates a 4km CONUS composite of the East and West GOES birds
for the archive and realtime apps.

<p><b>Please Note:</b>  This still remains a work in progress.  Please let us
know if you have any ideas on how this service can be improved.

<h3>Raw GIS Products</h3>

<div class="iem-form">
<strong>GOES East/West GeoTiff images for manual download</strong>
<br /><code><a href="http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/data/gis/images/4326/goes/">http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/data/gis/images/4326/goes/</a></code>
<br />The "1V" products are 1km Visible.  The "04I4" products are 4km infrared.

<p><p><p>
<strong>Conus GeoTiff images for manual download</strong>
<br /><code><a href="http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/data/gis/images/4326/sat/">http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/data/gis/images/4326/sat/</a></code>
<br />These images are generated by the IEM by combining data from the 
GOES East and West satellites.

<h3>OGC Web Map Service</h3>

<p>At this time, only the conus composites are available via the WMS.

<div class="iem-form">
<strong>WMS URL for conus GOES visible imagery</strong>
<br /><code>http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/sat/conus_vis.cgi?</code>

<p><strong>WMS URL for conus GOES infrared imagery</strong>
<br /><code>http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/sat/conus_ir.cgi?</code>
</div>

<h3>Archive</h3>

<p>The IEM is archiving the 4km visible and infrared composites.  This archive
exists since 20 December 2005.  Currently, the only way to download data is
to manually browse the IEM's data archive.
<div class="iem-form">
<strong>Today's archive of conus imagery (GeoTiff)</strong>
<br /><code><a href="http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/archive/data/<?php echo date("Y/m/d"); ?>/GIS/sat/">http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/archive/data/<?php echo date("Y/m/d"); ?>/GIS/sat/</a></code>
<br/>The URL pattern contains the year, month, and day.  The datafiles have
timestamps in UTC.

<h3>Online Applications</h3>
<ul>

<li>The <a href="http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/GIS/apps/rview/warnings.phtml">RADAR & NWS Warnings</a> app provides a neat web mapping interface combining
radar and satellite data along with NWS warning products.</li>

<li>The National Weather Service's <a href="http://nowcoast.noaa.gov">Nowcoast</a> portal site is extremely cool combining all sorts of data!
