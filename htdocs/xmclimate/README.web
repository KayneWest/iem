Samples of html pages and Perl/CGI scripts to support a web
interface.  

NOTE: These files are examples that will need some modification to work 
at another location.  

**-----------------------------------------------------------
coopobs.html  - this page is used to input coop observations from the web. An 
observation is submitted as email to a special address using the "FormMail.pl"
CGI script (http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/).  This method is needed
for web servers that do not have direct access to an xmclimate database.  
Alternative scripts might use a more direct method for updating xmclimate
data files.

findCOOPemail.ksh - script to check email for new coop observations
coopobs2shef.ksh  - script to convert email obervations to shef code.
shef2climate.pl   - Perl script for loading a shef message into 
		    an xmclimate file
