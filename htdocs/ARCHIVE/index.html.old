MesoNet Development Site</H3>

<P>This page is a test-bed and information resource for future MesoNet work.  I
plan on putting test images and archives here for general use and comment by the
public.  One of the major challenges of this project is understanding the needs
of the end-users.  It is very easy to create a site with current data on it and
archived data as well, but if the user's needs are not understood, they will not
be able to utilize this site.

<P><B>What is needed?</B><BR>
<UL>
	<LI>Clearly, the major purpose of this project is to combine data
	sources into one on-line resource.  The combined network is not meant to
	replace the smaller networks, but rather to provide a verification and
	supplemental source of MesoNet data.</LI>
	<LI>Currently the coverage of weather data sensors accross Iowa is
	lacking in some rural areas.  If you combine the automated networks into
	one product, the coverage becomes much better.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Features</B><BR>

<UL>
	<LI>Hourly MesoNet Plot viewable via the web, updated every hour</LI>
	<LI>Queriable archive of any and all data products generated from our
	remote data sensors.</LI>
	<LI>Ability for inter-comparison of MesoNet for real-time and historical
	data.</LI>
	<LI>Email gateway to the data archive.</LI>
	<LI>Utilize procedures like XML-RPC and SOAP to build remote querying
	methods.  Interactive programs built on this technology can provide more
	interactive displays than can be built from a web server.</LI>
	
</UL>

<P><B>Random Thoughts:</B><BR>

<P>I am very excited about the possibilites of this project.  I am very
optimistic about the features that can uniquely provided by this project.  Many
times, websites will have insightful interfaces to real-time data, but
no-archive capabilities or inter-comparison tools.

<P>One of the major issues that needs to be resolved is what formats the data
should be stored in and distributed.  There are many good data formats out
there and I will be interested in seeing what the users want.  I am guessing
that formats like netCDF, GEMPAK and plain ASCII will be popular, but I will be
looking to utilize open formats like XML to create truely cross platform data
types.

<P>An interesting use of the MesoNet would be to feed a locally run
high-resolution weather data models.


<P><B>Current Examples:</B><BR>

<P><a href="http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/wx/data/current/mesonet.gif">Here</a> is an Iowa surface data plot
generated every hour.  It combines Iowa DOT RWIS data with our IDD data.
