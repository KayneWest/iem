During the cold season (about November 1 to April 1) the rain gauges are
turned off.  The gauges record data via a tipping bucket mechanism which
would freeze and operate erratically during the winter.  No data is recorded
and all cold season days will report a 0.0 preciptation amount.   Therefore,
these data should not be used for any reporting purpose.
