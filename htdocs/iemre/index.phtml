<p>IEM Reanalysis is an effort to provide a regular 
dataset of Iowa Environmental Data without many of the problems associated
with single site observations.  The IEM will continue to provide single
site observational data, but for some purposes, this dataset will be easier
to work with.  <strong>No dataset is perfect and this dataset is provided
without warranty.</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Why do this?</strong>
 <br />Previously, the IEM has only provided raw observations with limited
quality control checks in place.  Quality control is hard!  Many times, users
are simply looking for something "close" and perhaps not as perfect as high
quality sensor observations can be.  Producing a gridded analysis is one
way to produce a dataset from point observations which can be sampled as
a means of spatial interpolation.</li>

 <li><strong>Why just Iowa? I'm interested in the corn belt.</strong>
 <br />Yes, someday we hope to expand to at least the corn belt.</li>

 <li><strong>Isn't this a duplication of effort?</strong>
 <br />While there are other "reanalysis" type projects out there with
data freely available, many times their data does not update in near real-time
and does not include many of the datasets the IEM uniquely collects. We may
also produce an analysis on sub-hourly timescales.</li>
</ul>
